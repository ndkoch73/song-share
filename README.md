# Song Share
Application created for 17-437 at Carnegie Mellon University.
Song share makes use of the spotify web API and Django to allow users 
to create live shares song queues. This means people can join currently live DJ's
and request song and vote on songs that can then be accepted and added to the DJ's
spotify queue. This application acts as a middle man for users to request song's at
social settings like parties.
